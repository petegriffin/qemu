/* AdvSIMD element data
 *
 * We pack all the additional information for elements into a single
 * 32 bit constant passed by register. Hopefully for groups of
 * identical operations on different registers this should propergate
 * nicely in the TCG.
 *
 * The following control element iteration:
 *   ADVSIMD_OPR_ELT  - the count of elements affected
 *   ADVSIMD_ALL_ELT  - the total count of elements (e.g. clear all-opr elements)
 *   ADVSIMD_DOFF_ELT - the offset for the destination register (e.g. foo2 ops)
 *
 * We encode immediate data in:
 *   ADVSIMD_DATA
 *
 * Typically this is things like shift counts and the like.
