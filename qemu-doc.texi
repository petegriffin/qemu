@section Features

QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to
achieve good emulation speed.

@cindex operating modes
QEMU has two operating modes:

@itemize
@cindex system emulation
@item Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for
example a PC), including one or several processors and various
peripherals. It can be used to launch different Operating Systems
without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.

@cindex user mode emulation
@item User mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch
processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. It can be used to
launch the Wine Windows API emulator (@url{https://www.winehq.org}) or
to ease cross-compilation and cross-debugging.

@end itemize

QEMU has the following features:

@itemize
@item QEMU can run without a host kernel driver and yet gives acceptable
performance.  It uses dynamic translation to native code for reasonable speed,
with support for self-modifying code and precise exceptions.

@item It is portable to several operating systems (GNU/Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X,
Windows) and architectures.

@item It performs accurate software emulation of the FPU.
@end itemize

QEMU user mode emulation has the following features:
@itemize
@item Generic Linux system call converter, including most ioctls.

@item clone() emulation using native CPU clone() to use Linux scheduler for threads.

@item Accurate signal handling by remapping host signals to target signals.
@end itemize

QEMU full system emulation has the following features:
@itemize
@item
QEMU uses a full software MMU for maximum portability.

@item
QEMU can optionally use an in-kernel accelerator, like kvm. The accelerators
execute most of the guest code natively, while
continuing to emulate the rest of the machine.

@item
Various hardware devices can be emulated and in some cases, host
devices (e.g. serial and parallel ports, USB, drives) can be used
transparently by the guest Operating System. Host device passthrough
can be used for talking to external physical peripherals (e.g. a
webcam, modem or tape drive).

@item
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support.  Currently, an in-kernel
accelerator is required to use more than one host CPU for emulation.

@chapter QEMU System emulator targets
@cindex system emulation (PC)

QEMU is a generic emulator and it emulates many machines. Most of the
options are similar for all machines. Specific information about the
various targets are mentioned in the following sections.
