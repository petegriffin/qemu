# Create Debian Bootstrap Image
#
# This is intended to be pre-poluated by:
#  - a first stage debootstrap
#  - a native qemu-$arch that binfmt_misc will run
FROM scratch

# HOST_CMD is executed by docker.py while building the context
HOST_CMD fakeroot debootstrap --variant=minbase --foreign --arch=$DEB_ARCH $DEB_TYPE . http://httpredir.debian.org/debian

# Add everything from the context into the container
ADD . /

# Patch all mounts as docker already has stuff set up
RUN sed -i 's/in_target mount/echo not for docker in_target mount/g' /debootstrap/functions

# Run stage 2
RUN /debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage

# At this point we can install additional packages if we want
#RUN apt-get update
#RUN apt-get dist-upgrade
